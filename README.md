# Data-Structures

This is my **Python Data Structures repo** where I save everything I learn.  
Includes explanations, Python code, and examples to practice.  

## What’s Inside
- **Arrays** – basics and dynamic arrays  
- **Linked Lists** – singly & doubly linked lists  
- **Stacks & Queues** – array and linked-list versions  
- **Trees** – binary trees, BST, AVL  
- **Graphs** – adjacency list & matrix  
- **Hashing** – hash tables
